## Welcome to Fluxera

We are a small software development business from northern germany. Based in the beautyul city of Bremen. After been around for about a decade, we decided to share what we learned and to give back to the OpenSource community. So we open sourced all of our internal libraries we use to build products for our clients.

Being a small business this is kind of a large endeavour. But we are nearly done polishing the code base and publishing NuGet packages. Please leave a comment or send us pull requests. We hope our base library, or parts of it will be useful for someone. If you like it: let us know. If you hate it: lets us know also. 😊
