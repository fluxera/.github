## Welcome to Fluxera

We are a small software development business from northern germany. Based in the beautyul city of Bremen. After been around for about a decade, we decided to share what we learned and to give back to the OpenSource community. So we open sourced all of our internal libraries we use to build products for our clients.

Being a small business this is kind of a large endeavour. But we are nearly done polishing the code base and publishing NuGet packages. Please leave a comment or send us pull requests. We hope our base library, or parts of it will be useful for someone. If you like it: let us know. If you hate it: lets us know also. ðŸ˜Š

### Fluxera Foundation Library

We mainly focus on developing applications using the .NET Framework and C#. Our portfolio includes but is not limited to ASP.NET (APIs, MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor), Xamarin Forms, WPF and other applications. The **Foundation Library** tries to provide a uniform base for any kind of application to develop. It consists of three areas:

1. Tools and utilities.
2. Domain-Driven Design, Integration and Infrastructure
3. Modular application infrastructure

The library itself stands on the shoulders of many Open Source giants and uses best-practices and well known projects to achieve its goals.
